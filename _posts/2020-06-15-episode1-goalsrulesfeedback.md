Super Mario Bros. World 1-1 is a treasure trove of game design discussion.  Here's just a few examples:

* MIT course where they determien that SMB is NP-Hard - http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.890/fall14/
* Evaluations by Extra Credits (who make amazing videos about all things games) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH2wGpEZVgE
* Game Revolution on "The Perfect Level" - https://www.gamerevolution.com/features/362525-perfect-level-super-mario-bros-world-1-1-changed-everything

So, how can I contribute to the conversation?  Well, I introduced the idea that a game is made up of goals, rules, feedback, and voluntary participation in the previous episode.  How do those concepts apply to World 1-1?  How are the rules communicated?  What sort of feedback is used?
