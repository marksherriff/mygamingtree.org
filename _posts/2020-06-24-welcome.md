Welcome to My Gaming Tree, a YouTube series on game design from the perspective of a computer science professor!  I'm Mark Sherriff and I'm a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Virginia, where I teach video game design, mobile app development, and software engineering.  Gaming has been a passion of mine for decades and I can't wait to put some of my thoughts down in these videos!  So, come join me under my gaming tree as I explore all sorts of topics and games!
