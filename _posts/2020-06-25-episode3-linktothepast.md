_The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past_ has one of the best intro / tutorial levels I have ever seen in gaming.  It clearly communicates your goals and objectives, steps the player through the different prodedures ("actions") that they can take, and explains the basic rules of the world through excellent level design.  

In this episode, I play through the begining of _A Link to the Past_!
