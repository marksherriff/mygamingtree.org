Episode 0 serves as a basic introduction to both the video series, the material, and me figuring out how I want to produce the videos :-).  

The discussion here is around what actually makes a game "a game."  There are several different definitions, but the one I like the most is:

> "A game is the voluntary attempt at overcoming unnecessary obstacles." - Bernard Suits

What a wonderful way of thinking about a game!  Games require that people agree to "play in this space" (to coin a phrase from one of my favorite podcasts - My Brother, My Brother, and Me) - to work within the limitations stipulated by a game in order to accomplish an objective.  That's what makes games (and certain kinds of "work" ... we'll get to that later) interesting.  When you have a limited toolset, what are you able to do?

Which brings us to the four main ingredients of a game:

* Goals (what are you working toward, both short and long-term)
* Rules (how will the game limit your choices and actions)
* Feedback (how do you know you are moving toward the goals)
* Voluntary Participation (you agree to "play in this space")
